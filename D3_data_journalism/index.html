          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>Looking at smoking percentage vs median income shows a clear negative association. In other words the higher your household's median income, the less likely it is that the members of the household are smokers. Our data does not necessarily provide a rational for this
            discovery; however, one possible theory worth exploring is the notion that individuals with a tendency to delay gratification
           <a href='https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0882-7974.11.1.79'>are linked to having having higher incomes.</a> It is possible that this tendency may also influence <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2886581/'>
          one's ability to quit smoking.</a>The graph of income vs obesity shows a very similar negative trend. Again, our data does not provide an explanation for this trend, but likely factors include access to healthcare increasing as one's income raises, as well as the aforementioned 
          tendency to delay gratification correlating with <a href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022347615011671'>lower BMIs.</a>
          </p>

          <p>The graph of obesity vs poverty shows a positive association. This is to be expected based on the negative association we see between median income level and obesity. The graph of smoking vs poverty shows a negative trend which-again-is expected based
            on the smoking vs median income graph.
